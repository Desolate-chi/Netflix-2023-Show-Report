# Netflix-2023-Show-Report

Introduction
In the ever-advancing landscape of technology, the film industry has experienced a significant surge in development, resulting in a doubling of the number of movies and shows released annually. Keeping abreast of these continuous improvements and understanding the leading countries and predominant genres in this field can be challenging. However, this challenge is now a thing of the past, thanks to the comprehensive insights provided by the 2023 version of the Extended Netflix Show Views dataset. Developed to enrich your understanding of this dynamic field, the dataset not only expands your knowledge but also reaffirms existing truths.

Data Preparation:
The inspiration for this project struck when I came across a video article mentioning Netflix's release of viewership data for the year. Intrigued, I promptly visited the Netflix website and downloaded the dataset.
 

Data Processing:
Eagerly delving into the data analysis, I quickly realized that the task at hand was more challenging than anticipated. While the dataset was excellent, I sensed a need for additional elements to breathe life into it. Returning to the drawing board, I conceptualized and implemented the insertion of new columns, including GENRE, CATEGORY, and COUNTRY PRODUCED.

 
Data Cleaning:
As the dataset underwent evolution, two crucial goals were identified to ensure its completeness:
1.	The original Netflix dataset comprised 17,000 rows, and upon validating its integrity, I discovered a concerning issue with the 'year release' column, containing 10,000 missing values. To address this challenge and meet project deadlines, I took the following steps:
 

   - Reduced the dataset to its top 10% for analysis.
   - Filled in missing values using resources from websites such as WHATâ€™S ON NETFLIX.COM and NEWONNETFLIX.COM.
   
2. The second goal involved handling missing values in the newly created columns, which was successfully accomplished with the assistance of IMDB and ROTTENTOMATOES.

Data Analysis and Investment Insights:
This project is meticulously designed to offer indispensable insights for investors navigating the dynamic landscape of the entertainment sector. It addresses pivotal questions that are paramount for strategic decision-making in the realm of entertainment investments. The key inquiries encompass:
1. Choosing Between TV Shows and Movies:
   - Uncover the comparative financial viability of financing TV shows versus movies. Gain clarity on the more lucrative investment avenue.
2. Optimal Movie Production Countries:
   - Identify the top three countries presenting the most promising investment opportunities for movie production. Delve into geographical insights to inform strategic investment decisions.
3. Profitable Genre Investment:
   - Ascertain the most profitable genre for investment within the entertainment industry. Navigate the diverse landscape of genres to maximize returns on investment.
4. Monthly Release Dynamics:
   - Pinpoint the month with the highest release rate in the year. Understand the temporal dynamics of content release to optimize investment timing.
These critical inquiries serve as the foundation for informed decision-making in the entertainment sector. Through comprehensive data visualizations derived from thorough dataset analysis, this project illuminates the path for investors seeking strategic and lucrative opportunities in the ever-evolving world of entertainment.
